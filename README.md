## Description

This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

The rules of the game are:

<ul>
    <li>When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    <li>When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play</li>
    <li>When the player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    <li>The player who first scores 100 or more points wins.</li>
